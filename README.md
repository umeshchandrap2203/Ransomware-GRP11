Project Title: Ransomware Simulation in a Controlled Virtual Environment
Description:
This GitHub repository hosts the materials and findings from a project aimed at understanding and mitigating ransomware threats through a controlled virtual simulation. The project was designed to explore the mechanisms, impacts, and defense strategies against ransomware attacks in a safe, isolated environment without real-world risks.

Key Features:
Simulation Environment: Utilized VirtualBox and Kali Linux to create a controlled setting where a ransomware attack was simulated on a Windows operating system, serving as the target machine.
Attack Process: Detailed the infection trigger, encryption mechanisms, and user interaction during the attack, including the display of a ransom note and encryption of critical files.
Encryption and Decryption: Implemented AES-256 encryption using the Fernet library to encrypt files and demonstrated the decryption process upon simulated receipt of ransom payment.
Impact Analysis: Discussed the operational disruption caused by ransomware, including data inaccessibility and potential downtime, highlighting the financial and reputational damage.
Educational Insights: Provided strategic insights into proactive cybersecurity measures, such as the importance of regular backups, software updates, and user training to mitigate ransomware risks.
Objectives:
The projectâ€™s objective was to simulate real-world ransomware tactics and defense strategies to provide insights into effective countermeasures and enhance preparedness against such cybersecurity threats.

Feel free to explore the repository for detailed simulation setups, findings, and recommendations on enhancing cybersecurity practices.
